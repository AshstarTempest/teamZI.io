        <h2>The Food Craving Dilemma</h2>
        <p>
          Many people struggle to decide what to eat when cravings strike.
          Despite having access to countless options, they often feel
          overwhelmed or uncertain about what will satisfy them. This indecision
          can lead to frustration, decision fatigue, or even settling for
          something unsatisfying. Our chatbot aims to solve this by asking
          targeted questions to quickly identify your preferences, helping you
          make the perfect food choice with minimal effort.
